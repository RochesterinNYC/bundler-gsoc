### Process Responsiblities

- Daily standup/check-in regarding what was done the day before, what will be worked on the current day, blockers, etc. This will be done via submitting issues in this repo. Please title the issues (`<Name> - <Date MM/DD/YYYY) - Standup Notes`
- Weekly retro at a pre-defined time.

### Coding Responsibilities

- Implement at least 4 bug/issue fixes every week and 1 feature request every 2 weeks.    [Tracker Board](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1582315)
- Assign yourself to stories in the tracker board. Finished status is when you are done with the coding for the issue or pull request. Delivered is when the pull request has been made and submitted. I will accept them on successful merge into the Bundler or other relevant repo.

### Maintenance Responsibilities

- Improve quality of issues/bugs: 
  - Ensure that issues have at least baseline enough `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock`, Bundler configuration, Ruby, Rubygems, 
    and system info. 
  - Ensure that reproduction steps are there if necessary.
  - Ensure that enough context is there as to what the user is trying to do and enough context to understand the 
    problem is.
